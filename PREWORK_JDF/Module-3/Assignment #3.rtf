\f0\fs24 \cf0 3. Put in the Hard Hours (At Least 20 Hours!)...\
\
I believe that most difficult aspect I\'92ll have with this course is putting in the work, and not because I\'92m not motivated. I have hobbies and a part time job that I absolutely love, which I can imagine might interfere with my study sessions. My main hobby is teaching salsa (which also happens to be my part time job), and like any skill one wants to improve, dedicated time is needed. If I keep the end goals in sight, which is a solid career, financial stability, the ability to support my family, and geographical freedom, I know I\'92ll be able to succeed. When I was a freshman in college I wanted to become fluent in Italian. I studied my note cards nightly and pushed toward my goal of living in Italy, which I eventually did. If I\'92ve accomplished a distant goal before, I\'92m 100% certain I can do it again. P.S. I\'92ve also wanted to learn how to create mobile apps that support useful daily devices - specifically NFC devices. I already have an invention in mind, but I\'92m not able to see it to fruition, yet!}
